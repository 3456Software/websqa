# Developer Setup
Running Windows? See: http://railsinstaller.org/en

Otherwise, this guide will help you get up and running on Linux. I'd recommend
Ubuntu or Fedora, but if you already have a distro up and running, anything will
work!

## Git
First things first, we'll install git! See
[GitHub's help page](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux)
for a detailed walkthrough.

## RVM: Ruby Version Manager
[RVM](http://rvm.io/) helps manage multiple versions of Ruby, since your system may or may not
have come with an older version already. Installing rvm is as easy as
```
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash
```
