%blockquote
  %p
    The WebSQA system is intended for use by a local software development company.
    The system is designed to facilitate the organization and tracking of software
    projects in development, and enable efficient communication of progress and
    requirements between Management, SQA Personnel, and Development Teams.
  %p
    The system will track which employees have been assigned to a given project,
    and present employees who log into the system with only information relevant
    to the projects to which they have access. It will follow projects along a
    development process according to requirements set by Managements. At each step,
    of the process, Administrators and Users assigned to the project will be able to
    see which requirements need to be completed, update their status, track
    updates made by others, and log meetings, defect reports, and comments.
  %p
    The system will use the information submitted to it to display a summary of the
    projectâ€™s status and progress, facilitating speedy review and approval of
    completed development steps by management. By managing project organization,
    tracking, and communication, the system will maximize the efficiency and
    productivity of Development Teams and SQA personnel, and facilitate more
    streamlined project management.
